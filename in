// So this is

# This insert a collection of places
insert places p1 p2 p3 p4

# This insert a collection of transitions
insert trans t1 t2

# Insertion of an arc with weight 1 and so on
insert arc p1 -> t1
insert arc p2 -> t2
insert arc p3 -> t2

# Insertion of an arc with arbitrary weight
insert arc t1 -> p2
insert arc t1 -> p3
insert arc t2 -> p4
insert arc t2 -> p1

# Set a specific toke
set token p2 2

# This print the places, transitions, edges, tokens  and the whole net respectively
print places
print trans
print edges
print tokens
print

# Test connectivity
test conn

# test if the net is pure
test purity
insert arc t1 -> p1
test purity

# Print the {pre, pos} condition and incidence matrix
print prec
print posc
print incidence

# This close the program
